            <p class="intro"> Florence and the Machine (stylized as Florence + the Machine) are an English 
                indie rock band that formed in London in 2007, consisting of lead vocalist 
                Florence Welch, keyboardist Isabella Summers, guitarist Rob Ackroyd, harpist 
                Tom Monger, and a collaboration of other musicians. The band's music has 
                received acclaim across the media, especially from the BBC, which played a 
                large part in their rise to prominence by promoting Florence and the Machine 
                as part of BBC Music Introducing. At the 2009 Brit Awards they received the 
                Brit Awards "Critics' Choice" award. The band's music is renowned for its 
                dramatic, eccentric production and Welch's powerful vocals.

                making it one of the best-selling albums of 2009 and 2010. The group's second 
                studio album, Ceremonials, released in October 2011, entered the charts at 
                number one in the UK and number six in the US. The band's third studio album, 
                How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, was released on 2 June 2015. It topped the 
                UK charts, and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, their first to 
                do so. The album reached number one in a total of eight countries and 
                the top ten of twenty. Also in 2015, the band was the headlining act at 
                Glastonbury Festival, making Welch the first British female headliner of the 
                21st century.
